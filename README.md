KnewsFeed is a news generating website that grabs articles from thousands of sources using the news api found on newsapi.org (currently). KnewsFeed also generates stock information
taken from yahoo finance using I web scraping serve I created.

With this website, you can search for news articles, see information from a bunch of different stocks and save articles you're interested in. 

**I am also working on making the application into a full fledged social media page where you can share articles, share stock information, post articles and information,
as well as send messages to people all from the website. By the end of November 2022, the application will be completed and will be availible on multiple platforms!
